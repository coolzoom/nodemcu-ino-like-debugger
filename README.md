# nodemcu-ino-like-debugger
Originally i planed to write some convenient library for NodeMCU for easy use. However I just too lazy to learn the tough Lua string functions.
so i end up with just the debugger.
This is a small lua script debugger for NodeMCU firmware, can also be used as a serial debugger.
this is just an Arduino-like clean interface, no codes inside use Arduino core.
